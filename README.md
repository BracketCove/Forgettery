# Forgettery

Edit: 2017
This Project was made a long time ago, and I was neither a good Android Developer back then, nor one that had spare time. I'd suggest you check out more recent Repos for up to date samples.

This project is a demonstration of how to build a working SQLite Database, via Asynctasks. Asynctasks are not necessarily the best approach to
managing a Database, but I feel that they allow a person to learn how to work with a database, and consider threading issues, without getting into
absurd amounts of boilerplate code. Feel free to give constructive criticism. I still have lots to learn.

Hopefully it helps. If you'd like to support me, add/like/subscribe to any of the following things:
