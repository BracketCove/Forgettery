This project is a demonstration of how to build a working SQLite Database, via Asynctasks. Asynctasks are not necessarily the best approach to
managing a Database, but I feel that they allow a person to learn how to work with a database, and consider threading issues, without getting into
absurd amounts of boilerplate code. Feel free to give constructive criticism. I still have lots to learn.

This project was created in Tandem with my youtube series here:

And also with a written tutorial series on my blog here:
